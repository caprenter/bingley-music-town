    <strong>Eldwick Church</strong> is looking for someone to play piano for hymns on Sunday mornings.

    They hope to have a few players who could be available on a rota basis,
    covering Sundays between them. The role would involve accompanying the choir during their rehearsal from 9:30 (not every week), and then playing during the service from 10:30 to around 11:20am.

    The instrument itself is a digital piano, it does have a few organ stops (which can be used if the player wishes but are not necessary) and otherwise it is a digital piano with two normal piano pedals.

    They may also be able to provide a DBS-checked driver to pick up the accompanist and take them home again afterwards, if needs be.

    Volunteers and Performers are needed for a new group that wants to give amateur musicians the chance to perform in a friendly supportive setting.

    Volunteers are needed for a new group that wants to give amateur musicians the chance to perform in a friendly supportive setting, with an emphasis on instruments that you might associate with an orchestra.  

    A similar opportunity can be found at the Bradford Music Club

    We're calling it [Sounds In Town]({% link sounds_in_town.md %}).
    
    <h3>Going Forward</h3>

    We think that music groups could host each event, as part of their normal routine. i.e.on the same day/evening that they rehearse.
 
    <strong>The idea is to:</strong> 
    Provide an appreciative sympathetic audience
    Not expect performances to be 'professional'
    Be a mix of musicians and non-performing audience
    Have a half time break so people can chat and mingle

    Performers would maybe:

    Be the pupils of music teachers
    Come from along the Aire Valley
    Be of any standard  - we would welcome learners

    We would need:
    A room with a good piano
    (4 - 6) People to organise the group/events
    A good MC (Master of Ceremonies) or host
    People to volunteer their help
    A regular evening(?) meeting time (7 -9?) and day (Monday?)

    Some places that might have a room and a piano:
    Cottingley Primary
    Beckfoot school
    Little Theatre
    Church House (
    Cullingworth Village Hall
    St Aidens Church, Crossflatts

    Other notes
    The Bradford Music Club is based around pre-booked 10 minute slots. There is a Leeds group that does a similar thing where auditions are required. Those in the room discussing the initial idea did not like the idea of auditions.

    There would be a cost to rent a space. Perhaps anyone that attends could pay a small amount to cover the cost. Spaces seem to be available from £13 - £20 per hour. We have a list of meeting spaces, with some idea of costs, that was collated in the last year.

    TASKS
    Find a group of people to do the work on this. If you are interested, or just want to find out more, please let us know at info@bingleymusictown.org.uk

    Find places that might have a room and a piano. Can you check our list above, or suggest somewhere else? Can you turn this into a list of Pro's and Con's for each venue?

    Find some people that might want to perform. Are you interested, do you know someone who might be? Let us know and we'll keep a list of people and their contact details.

    Find some people that might volunteer to help at events, even though they may not want to be more involved. Would you volunteer at an event to setup the room, meet and greet people, organise a performance running order, etc
