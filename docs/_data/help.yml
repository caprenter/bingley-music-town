    <strong>Eldwick Church</strong> is looking for someone to play piano for hymns on Sunday mornings.

    They hope to have a few players who could be available on a rota basis,
    covering Sundays between them. The role would involve accompanying the choir during their rehearsal from 9:30 (not every week), and then playing during the service from 10:30 to around 11:20am.

    The instrument itself is a digital piano, it does have a few organ stops (which can be used if the player wishes but are not necessary) and otherwise it is a digital piano with two normal piano pedals.

    They may also be able to provide a DBS-checked driver to pick up the accompanist and take them home again afterwards, if needs be.

#     Volunteers are needed for a new group that wants to give amateur musicians the chance to perform in a friendly supportive setting, with an emphasis on instruments that you might associate with an orchestra.  

#     A similar opportunity can be found at the Bradford Music Club

#     We're calling it [Sounds In Town]({% link sounds_in_town.md %}).
    
#     <h3>Going Forward</h3>

#     We think that music groups could host each event, as part of their normal routine. i.e.on the same day/evening that they rehearse.
 
#     <strong>The idea is to:</strong> 
#     Provide an appreciative sympathetic audience
#     Not expect performances to be 'professional'
#     Be a mix of musicians and non-performing audience
#     Have a half time break so people can chat and mingle

#     Performers would maybe:

#     Be the pupils of music teachers
#     Come from along the Aire Valley
#     Be of any standard  - we would welcome learners

#     We would need:
#     A room with a good piano
#     (4 - 6) People to organise the group/events
#     A good MC (Master of Ceremonies) or host
#     People to volunteer their help
#     A regular evening(?) meeting time (7 -9?) and day (Monday?)

#     Some places that might have a room and a piano:
#     Cottingley Primary
#     Beckfoot school
#     Little Theatre
#     Church House (
#     Cullingworth Village Hall
#     St Aidens Church, Crossflatts

#     Other notes
#     The Bradford Music Club is based around pre-booked 10 minute slots. There is a Leeds group that does a similar thing where auditions are required. Those in the room discussing the initial idea did not like the idea of auditions.

#     There would be a cost to rent a space. Perhaps anyone that attends could pay a small amount to cover the cost. Spaces seem to be available from £13 - £20 per hour. We have a list of meeting spaces, with some idea of costs, that was collated in the last year.

#     TASKS
#     Find a group of people to do the work on this. If you are interested, or just want to find out more, please let us know at info@bingleymusictown.org.uk

#     Find places that might have a room and a piano. Can you check our list above, or suggest somewhere else? Can you turn this into a list of Pro's and Con's for each venue?

#     Find some people that might want to perform. Are you interested, do you know someone who might be? Let us know and we'll keep a list of people and their contact details.

#     Find some people that might volunteer to help at events, even though they may not want to be more involved. Would you volunteer at an event to setup the room, meet and greet people, organise a performance running order, etc

     If playing with sound equipment, or sound engineering is your thing, we've got plenty of opportunities for you to get involved.
     
     Longer term we'd love to be able to be know as a town where there's always great sound when you come here to play, train up the next generation, and support people's employment in the industry.

    Would you like to get involved in putting on Live Music Events?   

    Plenty of people that are putting on Live Music Events locally are looking for people to help out.

    [Rumble Events Bingley](https://rumbleupbingley.co.uk/) is run by Bingley Music Town volunteers and there are opportunities to learn sound engineering, being a roadie, running the door and welcoming people, booking bands, promotion, publicity, websites, and so on.

    Can you help with the bandstand in Myrtle Park?   

    We're working hard to make sure the bandstand is alive and full of activity - especially music.

    Throughout the summer volunteers are need to help on event days to:
    <ul>
    <li>put the chairs out</li>
    <li>greet the performers</li>
    <li>set up the electrical sockets, and</li>
    <li>generally be around to help</li>
    </ul>

    There's also work to be done in the background:
    <ul>
    <li>organising the programme of events</li>
    <li>making posters and banners</li>
    <li>promotion and publicity</li>
    <li>liaising with performers, and so on</li>
    </ul>
    
    Longer term we'd like to help find funds to spruce up the bandstand itself, which probably requires quite a big funding bid to be written. Can you help?

    Along with other local groups, we're doing quite a lot of 'core' work, but our promotion and publicity skills could do with bolstering.

    We really need help with ideas, strategies, and people to actually do the work.

    We're looking for people who understand this world to help us out and get involved.
