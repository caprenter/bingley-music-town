        We are so lucky to have this large and beautiful park on our doorstep! 
        
        With two parks for the youngest visitors, an aviary, a skate park, adjacent allotment, cafe, two bowling greens, a bandstand and a large meadow for dog walks and pleasant picnics next to the river, Myrtle Park has something for everyone. 
        
        It's home to a variety of native trees and wildlife, making it the perfect antidote to our busy lives. 
        
        For the walkers among us, beautiful fields and further woodland can be accessed easily and a charming river walk under the canopy of the trees leads straight into Bingley. 
        
        The park is a generous host to popular, events such as the Bingley Show and welcoming runners every Saturday morning for the 5k parkrun. 
        
        In short, it brings such diverse pleasure to our lives. 
        
        Help us maintain and nurture this wonderful place!
