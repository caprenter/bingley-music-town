Bingley Music Town brings together the people that care about music in our area, to make sure there are great musical opportunities for everyone now, and into the future.

There's already so much going on, and there's also loads of ideas about what else could happen in our town and district.

We're working on a plan to make things happen, you're welcome to [join us]({{ site.baseurl }}/membership#become-a-member).

Get up to speed with what we're doing...
