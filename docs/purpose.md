Bingley Music Town brings together the people that care about music in our area, to make sure there are great musical opportunities for everyone now, and into the future.

<blockquote class="blockquote m-4 w-50 fw-bold"><p>"We're helping to make Bingley a place where music is celebrated and valued as an asset that sustains our health, our wellbeing, and our economy."</p></blockquote>

There's already so much going on, so we're simply connecting people, sharing ideas, and using each other to make things happen around music. 

You're welcome to [join us]({{ site.baseurl }}/membership).

## Background Documents

These documents were written as we were first getting started and represent the discussions and ideas we had back then, many of which are still relevant.
