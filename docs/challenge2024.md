Bingley Music Town is running the Bandstand Stage for the [Challenge Festival](https://challengefestival.co.uk/) that takes place in Myrtle Park on 25th and 26th May 2024.

# Volunteer

If you'd like to help us organise and run the event, [please get in touch](({% link contact.md %})).

# Sponsors

Thanks to all of our sponsors.

{% include sponsors.html %}

This is not-for-profit festival, but getting your band together to play still costs money, so with the help of our sponsors we're able to pay the acts something towards their costs.

We've also had some sponsorship to feed and water our volunteers over the two days.

There will be music both days from 12 noon until 9pm, with a new act starting every hour on the hour. The last act will be on stage at 8pm.
