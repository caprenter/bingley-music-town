One of the highlights of the summer of 2025 was the live music on the Bandstand in [Myrtle Park]({% link _venues/myrtle_park.md %}), and plans are underway for 2026. 

<div class="row g-0">
<div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">
This was the first year in very long time that we've had so much use out of the Bandstand.

There were 30 concerts between May and September in 2025.

The concerts are brought to you by the [Friends of Myrtle Park<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofmyrtlepark), [Bingley Town Council<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/), [Bradford Parks<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://bradforddistrictparks.org/), and ourselves. 

## Music in 2026
We've got the funding in place to have music every Saturday and Sunday in the Summer of 2026.
