# Mini-Fest at the Rugby Club 

The [Bradford And Bingley Rugby Club]({% link _venues/bradford_and_bingley_rugby_club.md %}) stepped in to save the music that was planned for bandstand when Challenge Festival was cancelled at the last minute.

The page below retains some of the information for the day and updates since the event passed.

<!--
## Please Note
* This will be an indoor festival
* It is not the full Challenge Festival line up it is ONLY the acts that were going to be playing on the bandstand.
* The mini-fest will run the same artists at the same time, on the same days, just at a different place (BUT check back for any last minute changes!)
* The bar at the Rugby Club is a card only bar
-->

## Why the last minute change?

The larger [Challenge Festival](https://challengefestival.co.uk/) was [cancelled](https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/24336257.challenge-festival-myrtle-park-bingley-cancelled/) on the Tuesday before the event.

We're grateful for the offers of help and support that we've had, and to the [Bradford And Bingley Rugby Club]({% link _venues/bradford_and_bingley_rugby_club.md %}) for stepping in.

# Volunteer

We had about a dozen people volunteering with us on the day. If you'd like to help us organise and run similar events in the future, [please get in touch]({% link contact.md %}).

# Sponsors

Thanks to all of our sponsors.

{% include sponsors.html %}

This is not-for-profit festival, but getting your band together to play still costs money, so with the help of our sponsors we're able to pay the acts something towards their costs.

We've also had some sponsorship to feed and water our volunteers over the two days.

# Venue

[Bradford And Bingley Rugby Club]({% link _venues/bradford_and_bingley_rugby_club.md %}), Club Wagon Lane, Bingley, BD16 1LT.

</main>


# Line Up

There was music from 12 noon until 9pm on the Saturday and from 12 noon until 8pm on the Sunday. A new act started every hour on the hour. The last act was on stage at 8pm (Sat) and 7pm (Sun).

There were 17 acts over the two days. Between act, music was provided by The Collector.

Leeds and Yorkshire.

Her distinctive rippling, almost Philip Glass evoking, acoustic guitar style sets the tone for a heart melting voice with a Celtic timbre that pulls the emotion out of the lyric. This can be heard in her debut album Roots & Wings, released in 2019.
