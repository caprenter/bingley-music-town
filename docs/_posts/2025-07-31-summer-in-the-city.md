## Sound of Music 25th-27th July 2025

The second year of "Bingley The Sound of Music" was a big hit in the town once again.

Organised by the local pubs and designed to support home-grown talent, there was live music spread out over three days, and at various times throughout the day, allowing people to move around the town, experience new music and explore different venues.

## Summer Market - Saturday 19th July 2025

Musicians joined stall holders and market traders in Market Square in Bingley to bring the sounds of summer to shoppers in town.

The event was made possible by Richard at RSH Artisan Markets, Cllr Joe Wheatley, Eldwick Gala, and Bingley Music Town volunteers. 

We were lucky to have 8 acoustic acts who joined us between 10am-4pm, busking their way through the rain and keeping the passers by and traders entertained.  

There was an assortment of music; The Wild Rover (The Dubliners), New York New York (Frank Sinatra), Hand In My Pocket (Alanis Morissette), Thinking Out Loud (Ed Sheeran), with songs to suit all. 

Thank you to all the buskers who came, we hope you all enjoyed it despite the weather.
