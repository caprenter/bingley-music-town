The Bradford Accordion Band has been nominated as a shortlistee for the [2026 Royal Philharmonic Society's Inspiration Award](https://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/rps_music_awards/inspiration-award).

The event is often called the 'BAFTAS for Classical Music', so it's all very exciting! 

The winner will be decided by public vote and the group has been invited to attend the Awards Ceremony at the South Bank Centre in  London on the 12th March 2026. 

The [Inspiration Award](https://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/rps_music_awards/inspiration-award) is the only one that is given to non-professional performers and celebrates the work of community and amateur musicians from all over the UK. There are only 4 nominees, so it's already a great honour to be chosen.
