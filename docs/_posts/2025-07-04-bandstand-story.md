Why is the bandstand so full of music this year? Local Town Councillor, John Goode, explains all.

<div class="col-md-8" markdown="1">
Three years ago [Bradford Council](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/) funded four free Sunday concerts in the Myrtle Park bandstand.

Last year (2024) [Bingley Town Council](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/) agreed funding to provide  a number of extra concerts, [Bradford District Parks](https://bradforddistrictparks.org/) managed to arrange nine concerts. ([Bradford Council](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/) paid for three and the other six by [Bingley Town Council](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/)).

It was only possible to book nine concerts last year, as some bands/entertainers need an electricity supply.

Due to a major commitment/investment by [Bingley Town Council](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/) a permanent electric supply has now been installed. The majority of the funding for this project came from an accumulation of Community Infrastructure Levy payments ([Bingley Town Council](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/) receive 15% from [Bradford Council](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/) which they charge on some new developments)

This year [Bradford District Parks](https://bradforddistrictparks.org/) have booked a concert on every Sunday from 1st June to 31st of August usually held between 2-4 pm (of which they will once again will pay for three of them).

[Bingley Town Council](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/) have now formed an excellent working relationship with the [Bradford District Parks](https://bradforddistrictparks.org/) team, [Friends of Myrtle Park]() and Bingley Music Town who provide volunteers on concert days.

Bingley Music Town have also arranged a number of extra concerts which will be performed mainly on Saturday's between 2-4pm. Details can be found on the Bingley Music Town website and on the [Bingley Town Council events page](https://www.bingleytowncouncil.gov.uk/local-events).
