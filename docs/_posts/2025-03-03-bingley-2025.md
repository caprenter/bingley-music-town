Bingley is celebrating being part of the City Of Culture by teaming up with Bradford 2025 to deliver a number of local events.

Bingley Music Town is playing it's part, supporting music making, learning, and performances across the district.

See our dedicated [Bradford 2025 page]({% link bradford2025.md %}), where you can see a planning calendar of events that we think will be taking place locally in 2025. We're pleased to be helping out other local Bingley 2025 organisers where we can.
