[This is Bingley<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x_-RAlYt_w) was launched on International Make Music Day (June 21st) at [Bingley Arts Centre](% link _venues/bingley_arts_centre.md %) where over 100 people from local schools, families and the wider community came together to celebrate the town, music making, and to hear the world premier of the song and video.

Local rapper Wilko Wilkes worked with pupils from Beckfoot Priestthorpe Primary School, Lady Lane Park School, Eldwick Primary School, St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Crossflatts Primary School, and Myrtle Park Primary School, to create a song that celebrates the local area. 

The song (and the video, created by Stu Herring and Wilko) takes you on a journey through some of Bingley’s attractions and most-loved places.

Wilko said: “Working with these young people was an absolute pleasure, and I was so impressed with their efforts. 

“We had a short time together, and what they produced was brilliant. They can be proud of themselves, and we hope the whole of Bingley gets to enjoy this song and is proud of them too.” 

Councillor Susan Fricker said: “The Bingley community has been working together since 2023 to make the most of being a part of our District year as the UK City of Culture. 

“Activities and events are happening throughout the year to offer creative opportunities to everyone in Bingley. 

“Wilko Wilkes has led workshops with children from our Primary Schools to create the wonderful song ‘This is Bingley’ - we hope everyone in Bingley will enjoy the song and join in with this celebration of our brilliant Bingley.”

It brought together over 100 people from local schools, families and the wider community to celebrate the town through music.

‘This is Bingley’ is the latest creation from rapper Wilko, who is on a mission to leave a positive mark on the world through music.

The founder of social enterprise Rap for Good has played headline gigs and opened for Arrested Development and Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer.

He is an award-winning alternative rapper, songwriter, music producer and rap workshop facilitator.
