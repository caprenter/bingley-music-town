If you head down to [Bingley Library](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/libraries/find-your-local-library/bingley-library/) on a Wednesday between about 11am and 3pm you should come across  Bingley Library Acoustic Session Time (BLAST). As long as it's not the third Wednesday of the month... 

This is a group of people that come to sing and play together every week, and the library is more than happy to provide a space for them to do that.

But on the third Wednesday of the month there's a clash so they can't do it then. So, during the summer they've headed out Myrtle Park and have been playing on the bandstand.

You can catch them again on the 20th August between 11am and 3pm on the bandstand in [Myrtle Park]({% link _venues/myrtle_park.md %}) (weather permitting).

You can usually find about a dozen musicians in the library each week. They tend to take it in turns to sing and play. You might hear covers of songs by John Martyn, Little Walter, Rosanne Cash, Gillian Welch, John Prine, Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Patsy Matheson, Laura Cantrell, and many more. You might also catch a few original songs, old and new, written by the musicians themselves.

In preparation for their outing to the bandstand, we've compiled a [YouTube playlist of some of the songs that you might hear](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHOGudsAg6qyUqg3KeQCGRWdQlK77uR0I&si=gmQLsWRPxeoXX3vG) if you turn up.
