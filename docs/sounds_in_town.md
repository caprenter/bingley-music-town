Sounds In Town is an initiative to give local (amateur) musicians and singers of any ability the chance to perform to a sympathetic, supportive and appreciative audience. 

The events are based on the [Bradford Music Club](http://www.bradfordmusicclub.org.uk/) model where performers get a 10 minute maximum performance 'spots'. 

Each event is FREE to attend although we do ask for voluntary donations upon exit from our audience to help pay for the venue costs and to fund future events. 

The hope is that each Sounds in Town evening will have a different host/venue and we are seeking to make these quarterly events (at the least), but that will depend upon people being willing to come along and play and host!
