description: "We ring on Sundays, 9.45-10.30am for morning service and practice on
  Tuesday evenings, 7.30-9.00pm.  \n\nThe bells are also rung for weddings, other
  occasions of joy, and of sadness, and sometimes by visiting bands of ringers. Most
  years we attempt to ring a peal, usually on Remembrance Sunday or on All Saints'
  Day.\n\nWe are always willing to welcome new recruits to train and become part of
  our team, You do not have to be strong or musical.You do have to be available to
  ring on most Sundays, aged 12+ with no upper age limit, have a sense of timing and
  a sense of humour!\n\nIf you are interested, please pay us a visit one Tuesday,
  there is no obligation to learn.\n"
