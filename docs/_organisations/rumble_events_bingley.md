description: "A regular gig night run by volunteers that provides opportunities for
  anyone that wants to learn about putting on live music events.\n\nIf you want to
  help shift gear and set up the stage, sound and lights, or learn to sound engineer,
  or run the door and merch stalls, or simply welcome people to the events, then this
  is a safe place for to have a go. \n\nThis used to be Rumble Up The Ryshworth, but
  has changed it's name since moving to a new venue. "
