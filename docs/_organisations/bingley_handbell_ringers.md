  We  meet regularly to practise handbell tune ringing and we enjoy  entertaining people.

  New members are always welcome. Reading  music is not essential but a sense of  rhythm, fun and a good sense of humour always helps! Our practice nights are held in the  church vestry and vary between Monday and Wednesday evenings.
