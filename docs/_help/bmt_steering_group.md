  We are a members organisation so we need people to look after the membership, listen to their ideas, and help them turn their ideas into reality.

  Our steering group has room for up to 12 people. We meet once a month for an hour, and generally take on small tasks to do between meetings.

  For an informal chat, with no strings attached, just get in touch.
