description: "Volunteers are needed for a new group that wants to give amateur musicians
  the chance to perform in a friendly supportive setting, with an emphasis on instruments
  that you might associate with an orchestra.  \n\nA similar opportunity can be found
  at the Bradford Music Club\n\nWe're calling it [Sounds In Town]({% link sounds_in_town.md
  %}).\n\n<h3>Going Forward</h3>\n\nWe think that music groups could host each event,
  as part of their normal routine. i.e.on the same day/evening that they rehearse.\n\n<strong>The
  idea is to:</strong> \nProvide an appreciative sympathetic audience\nNot expect
  performances to be 'professional'\nBe a mix of musicians and non-performing audience\nHave
  a half time break so people can chat and mingle\n\nPerformers would maybe:\n\nBe
  the pupils of music teachers\nCome from along the Aire Valley\nBe of any standard
  \ - we would welcome learners\n\nWe would need:\nA room with a good piano\n(4 -
  6) People to organise the group/events\nA good MC (Master of Ceremonies) or host\nPeople
  to volunteer their help\nA regular evening(?) meeting time (7 -9?) and day (Monday?)\n\nSome
  places that might have a room and a piano:\nCottingley Primary\nBeckfoot school\nLittle
  Theatre\nChurch House (\nCullingworth Village Hall\nSt Aidens Church, Crossflatts\n\nOther
  notes\nThe Bradford Music Club is based around pre-booked 10 minute slots. There
  is a Leeds group that does a similar thing where auditions are required. Those in
  the room discussing the initial idea did not like the idea of auditions.\n\nThere
  would be a cost to rent a space. Perhaps anyone that attends could pay a small amount
  to cover the cost. Spaces seem to be available from £13 - £20 per hour. We have
  a list of meeting spaces, with some idea of costs, that was collated in the last
  year.\n\nTASKS\nFind a group of people to do the work on this. If you are interested,
  or just want to find out more, please let us know at info@bingleymusictown.org.uk\n\nFind
  places that might have a room and a piano. Can you check our list above, or suggest
  somewhere else? Can you turn this into a list of Pro's and Con's for each venue?\n\nFind
  some people that might want to perform. Are you interested, do you know someone
  who might be? Let us know and we'll keep a list of people and their contact details.\n\nFind
  some people that might volunteer to help at events, even though they may not want
  to be more involved. Would you volunteer at an event to setup the room, meet and
  greet people, organise a performance running order, etc\n"
