description: "Can you help with the bandstand in Myrtle Park?   \n\nWe're working
  hard to make sure the bandstand is alive and full of activity - especially music.\n\nThroughout
  the summer volunteers are need to help on event days to put the chairs out, greet
  the performers, set up the electrical sockets, and generally be around to help.\n\nThere's
  also work to be done in the background organising the programme of events, making
  posters and banners, promotion and publicity, liaising with performers, and so on.\n\nLonger
  term we'd like to help find funds to spruce up the bandstand itself, which probably
  requires quite a big funding bid to be written. Can you help?\n"
