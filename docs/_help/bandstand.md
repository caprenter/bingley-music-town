description: "Can you help with the bandstand in Myrtle Park?   \n\nWe're working
  hard to make sure the bandstand is alive and full of activity - especially music.\n\nThroughout
  the summer volunteers are need to help on event days to:\n<ul>\n<li>put the chairs
  out</li>\n<li>greet the performers</li>\n<li>set up the electrical sockets, and</li>\n<li>generally
  be around to help</li>\n</ul>\n\nThere's also work to be done in the background:\n<ul>\n<li>organising
  the programme of events</li>\n<li>making posters and banners</li>\n<li>promotion
  and publicity</li>\n<li>liaising with performers, and so on</li>\n</ul>\n\nLonger
  term we'd like to help find funds to spruce up the bandstand itself, which probably
  requires quite a big funding bid to be written. Can you help?\n"
