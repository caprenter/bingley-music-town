  of people that are putting on Live Music Events locally are looking for people to
  help out.\n\nOne such event is [Rumble Up The Ryshworth](https://rumbleupbingley.co.uk/)
  which is run by Bingley Music Town volunteers and there are opportunities to learn
  sound engineering, being a roadie, running the door and welcoming people, booking
  bands, promotion, publicity, websites, and so on. \n"
