### May 16th - June 26th 2024

An exhibition of photographs celebrating music in the Bingley district taken by members of Bingley Camera Club.

The exhibition is in seven windows on Main Street, Bingley and in [Bingley Arts Centre<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bingleyartscentre.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (open 10 am - 1 pm Monday-Friday).

This exhibition is to tell the story of people in Bingley having fun making and listening to music. It results from a collaboration between the enthusiastic hobby photographers at [Bingley Camera Club<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bingleycameraclub.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and the local musicians and music lovers who have come together to form Bingley Music Town. 

We have spent the last year photographing as many activities as possible, and here we present 20 images of some of the people involved in making local music in our varied venues. Between May 16th and June 26th 2024 we also have displays in seven windows on Main Street and a print exhibition in [Bingley Arts Centre<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bingleyartscentre.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
