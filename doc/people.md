### Steering Group
{% include steering-group.md %}

#### Mike Wheatley (Chair)
I have been playing in [Playing For Kicks]({% link _organisations/playing_for_kicks.md %}) covers band since 2010 and also organise a monthly [Open Mic]({% link _organisations/the_shed_planners_association_-_bfd.md %}) night. I’ve lived in Bingley for 16 years. I want more people to know about all the great music that’s already happening, and encourage more music events in our town.

#### Becs Leighton (Secretary)
I teach piano, flute and music theory at [Becs Leighton<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.becsleightonmusic.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and I co-founded [Bradford and Airedale Youth Choir]({% link _organisations/bradford_airedale_youth_choir.md %}). I am passionate about creating local opportunities in music for young people, because these experiences change futures.  

#### David Carpenter (Treasurer)
I have a background in community work and technology. I make music and sounds as [The Argent Grub<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and I've lived in Bingley for over 20 years. My interest in the music town is geared towards anything that helps people make music for themselves.  

#### Anita Bašić
I am the founder and Musical Director of [Bradford Accordion Band (BAB)]({% link _organisations/bradford_accordion_band.md %}) who were established in 1997. My musical mission is to encourage as many people as possible to play an instrument they love, as part of a group. I have lived in the Bingley area for over 20 years and know that this Town has talent! 

#### Stephanie Laycock
I am a lover of plays, musical theatre and pantomimes and have been performing with [Keighley Musical Theatre Company<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://keighleymtc.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} since 2005. I believe everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy and take part in music and the arts in their own town. 

#### Liz Narey
I am a local folk singer,songwriter, guitar player, and teacher. I run [Bingley First Monday Folk<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1823602681007824){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Bingley Singing For Fun]({% link _organisations/bingley_singing_for_fun.md %}). I really enjoy collaborating with other musicians and instrumentalists at workshops, sessions, and one-to-one. I'm a regular at our local folk clubs - [The Topic<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://www.nawaller.com/topicfc/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Bacca Pipes<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://baccapipes.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [Otley<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://www.otleyfolkclub.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Wetherby<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://wetherbyfolk.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} Folk Clubs. I got involved with Bingley Music Town to support the team and to bring music to the attention of more people in the area.
