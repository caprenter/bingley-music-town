  <strong>Eldwick Church</strong> is looking for someone to play piano for hymns on Sunday mornings.

  They hope to have a few players who could be available on a rota basis,
  covering Sundays between them. The role would involve accompanying the choir during their rehearsal from 9:30 (not every week), and then playing during the service from 10:30 to around 11:20am.

  The instrument itself is a digital piano, it does have a few organ stops (which can be used if the player wishes but are not necessary) and otherwise it is a digital piano with two normal piano pedals.

  They may also be able to provide a DBS-checked driver to pick up the accompanist and take them home again afterwards, if needs be.
