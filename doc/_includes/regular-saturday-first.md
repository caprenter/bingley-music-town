<span class="activity">Jam Session</span><br>
For acoustic instruments (or lightly amplified electric instruments using battery power).<br>
This is a Jam Session where somebody leads-off a song and everybody joins in ... quite a different beast to Open Mic events where songs etc are performed.<br>
3pm-5pm, [The Flappit Inn](https://theflappit.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (A629 Keighley to Halifax road, near Cullingworth)<br>
