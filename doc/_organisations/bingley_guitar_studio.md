  My name is Dave Johnson and I set up Bingley Guitar Studio in 2004. Since then I have tutored and mentored hundreds of students, from youngsters aged 7 to mature first timers, I have successfully taught the skills to many who aspired to make music with the electric, acoustic and bass guitar.

  Everybody’s ‘guitar journey’ is unique and I can quickly identify the interests and aspirations of new students and then work out the most interesting way for them to learn the necessary skills and techniques to make learning fun and enjoyable.

  Enjoying the process is the quickest way to  success!
