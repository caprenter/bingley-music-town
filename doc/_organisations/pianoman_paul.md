  Pianoman Paul (Paul Jannetta) is a piano teacher, musician, song writer, and pioneer of the West Yorkshire dance music scene.

  Whether you are a complete novice starting out, intermediate looking at taking grades or an accomplished player and looking for advanced sessions in soloing techniques and live performance then I can help.

  I  have been teaching for 10+ years.
  At the moment my youngest student is 6 and my oldest is 83.
  I cover ABRSM, Rock School, Trinity and Trinity Rock and Pop.
  I have a 100% exam pass rate.

  I also offer regular (monthly) opportunities for students to perform at Live at the Lounge in Shipley which I run with two other music tutors.
