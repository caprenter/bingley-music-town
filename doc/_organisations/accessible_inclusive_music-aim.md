description: "Accessible Inclusive Music (A.I.M.) are a Shipley-based charity led
  by specialist music practitioner Sarah Dunn. \nThey provide fully-inclusive musical
  activities, with a strong commitment to ensuring musical opportunities for all.\n\nTheir
  online inclusive choir is yet again running for FREE, thanks to a Connecting Communities
  grant from Scope (funded by Charities Aid Foundation) and funds raised by students
  of Becs Leighton Music at their Christmas Concert.\n\nAll children up to the age
  of 18 can join, and participate with their voice, their body, Makaton signing, voice-output
  devices, switchesâ€¦ any and all means of communicating and creating music are facilitated.
