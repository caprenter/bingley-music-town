description: "The Friends of Myrtle Park help look after our local park and make sure
  interesting things, including music, happen there.\n\nWe are so lucky to have this
  large and beautiful park on our doorstep! \n\nWith two parks for the youngest visitors,
  an aviary, a skate park, adjacent allotment, cafe, two bowling greens, a bandstand
  and a large meadow for dog walks and pleasant picnics next to the river, Myrtle
  Park has something for everyone. \n\nIt's home to a variety of native trees and
  wildlife, making it the perfect antidote to our busy lives. \n\nFor the walkers
  among us, beautiful fields and further woodland can be accessed easily and a charming
  river walk under the canopy of the trees leads straight into Bingley. \n\nThe park
  is a generous host to popular, events such as the Bingley Show and welcoming runners
  every Saturday morning for the 5k parkrun. \n\nIn short, it brings such diverse
  pleasure to our lives. \n\nHelp us maintain and nurture this wonderful place!"
